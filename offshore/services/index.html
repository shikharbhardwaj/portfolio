  <h2>Reconciliation Services</h2>

  <div class = "col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">
    <br>
    <p>With about a decade of experience in the industry, Fin-Offshore has
    perfected its methods when it comes to account reconciliation. Bank
    reconciliations, Inter-company reconciliations and Substantiation (B/S and
    P/L) are some of the reconciliation services offered by us.</p>
    <p>Reconciliation is the process of comparing information that exists in two
    systems or locations, analyzing differences and making corrections so that
    the information is accurate, complete and consistent in both locations. All
    funds within the balance sheet account must be included in the
    reconciliation unless previous arrangements have been made. Without
    performing reconciliations, inaccurate recording of transactions may occur
    that would result in incorrect reporting and could impact resources.</p>
    <p><b>Balance Sheet Account Reconciliation:</b>
    A balance sheet account reconciliation is the comparison of an account’s
    general ledger balance to a sub-ledger balance, bank or other third party
    statement, or additional documentation that appropriately supports the
    account’s balance.  Reconciliations may be performed daily, monthly, or
    quarterly based on whether an account is defined as high, medium, or low
    risk by the business.
    </p>
    <p><b>Other Reconciliation Services:</b>
    Company is also engaged into other reconciliation services basis the requirement.
